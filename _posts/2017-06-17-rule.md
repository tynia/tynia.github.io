This is a introduction for blog to be posted.

- The file name must named according to ***"YYYY-MM-DD-name.md"***.
- If there will be a new category, you must add a category file in directory:`catagory`, which is used to separate blogs posted.
- Images used in different blog should be named and placed regularly in directory:`assets`.
- ... 

All rules above are the limits to post blogs.
For more, you should learn the syntax of Markdown to write blogs, and the jekyll engine will explain it to html for exploring.

At last, Happy your study.
